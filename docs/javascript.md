## What is Javascript

Javascript is interpreted, cross-platform, object-oriented, runtime compiled `scripting` language.

It is used to make web pages interactive.

HTML structures the web page, CSS adds style like color, fonts, etc but a web page with only HTML and
CSS is static, meaning a user cannot really interact with the page.

### Going back to 1990's
- Brendan Eich from Netscape developed a Computer Programming Language.
- Named it as Mocha -> LiveScript -> Javascript

### How to Run JavaScript?
- We need a Modern Browser to run JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari ...)
- We need a browser because javascript is a scripting language it cannot execute on its own, so the browser does the work of executing the JS script. 
- https://v8.dev/ V8 is a JS Engine for JavaScript

### Features
- Cross-platform: Javascript is supported by many OS such as Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

- Object Oriented: Javascript is an object oriented programming language, but it is not a class based OOP language like Java, C++, etc. It is a prototype based OOP language.

- Scripting language: Javascript is a scripting language it depends on the browser for the execution of scripts. It is mostly used as a client-side scripting language this means that it runs on the client's system (browser) and handles the webpages displayed to the user and the processing related to it such as cookies, sessions, local storage.

- Dynamically typed: Javascript is dynamically typed, it means type checks happen at run-time. In JS we don't have to explicitly declare what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. For example when we declare var a, now a can have a string stored in or a number as well.

- Loosely/weakly typed: Loosely/weakly typed languages allows for implicit conversion of types. For example, in Javscript we can declare a var a and give it some value and if we use + operator with a string variable a will be treated as string and as a number if we do the operation with a number, var a is converted implicitly here.

- Case sensitive: Javascript is sensitive to the case of the letters.

- Browser support: Javascript is supported by all major web browsers example Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.

- JIT compiled is compiled by a JIT(Just in time) compiler which converts the JS code to byte code.

- Interpreted: Javascript is using an interpreter to convert the byte to machine code hence is it an interpreted language. light weight and interpreted language.

- light-weight: Light weight refers to a language which has fewer language constructs(any syntactically allowable part of a language such as if..else,functions etc), since JS fits this criteria it is a light weight programming language. (Note: It should be noted that with each new version released new constructs get added so JS is getting less light weight but it is still light weight compared to other programming languages like C++, Java etc)

### Usage
- Web and Mobile Development
- Server Side Development (NodeJS)
- Game Development
- Art & Animation

### Client Side Usage
- Client side javascript is used to manipulate the contents of a webpage, provide user interaction etc.
